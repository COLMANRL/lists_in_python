# 📝 Python List Manipulation Example

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to work with lists.  
The script performs several basic list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding an index.

## 📋 Operations Performed

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the values: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index 1).
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Prints the index of the value `30`.

## 🧪 Example Output
